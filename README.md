# GAN_CelebA
This is my first attempt at developing a GAN using keras to generate faces using the CelebA dataset. I tried the method used by Andrew Sommerlot (link yo the repository: https://github.com/andrewsommerlot/GAN-Face-Generation) to input noise of dimensions 32 x 32 x 3, same as the dimensions of the output image.
